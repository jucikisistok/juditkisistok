    description = "<b>Being a teaching assistant</b><br/>I had a fantastic time teaching 20+ lovely molecular biology BSc students in the fall of 2017 and spring of 2018. The fall course involved python programming and using online bioinformatics tools (like BLAST), while the spring course focused on statistics and R. To help my students understand the concepts more, I prepared extra materials for them that you can see here:<br /><a href='https://github.com/jucikisistok/biap' target='_blank'>Bioinformatics and Programming course notes</a><br /><a href='https://gaos.netlify.com/' target='_blank'>Genome Analysis and Statistics notebooks</a><br /><br /><b>muggerNN</b><br />As part of our Master's thesis, my dear friend and thesis partner, Noor and me implemented a command-line tool to predict protein secondary structure that we lovingly called muggerNN (working title). Not only did we get pretty good at implementing different kinds of neural networks in Keras (from simple one-layer to deep convolutional nets), we also learnt a lot about data wrangling, cluster computing, patience, teamwork and time management."
